# Bidding Application

This project is a **multithreaded bidding application** built with **Java** and **JavaFX**, allowing users to participate in live auctions over a local Wi-Fi network. The application features real-time bid updates, user role management (registered user or guest), and a user-friendly interface for a seamless bidding experience.

## Features:
- **Real-Time Bidding**: All participants receive instant updates when bids are placed.
- **User Roles**: Login as a registered user or guest.
- **Bid Management**: Start new bids, place bids, and close auctions, with results updated in real time.
- **Cross-Device Access**: Accessible from any computer connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- **Multithreading**: Ensures smooth, concurrent operations for multiple users without lag.
- **JavaFX Interface**: Simplifies navigation, bid tracking, and user interaction.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Core logic and backend.
- **JavaFX**: For building the GUI.
- **Multithreading & Parallel Programming**: To handle multiple users interacting with the server concurrently.

## How it Works:
1. Users can log in as a guest or a registered user.
2. Users can place bids on items, and these bids are broadcasted to all other users in real-time.
3. The system handles bid initiation, placement, and closing.
4. Bids and results are accessible from any device on the same network, allowing seamless participation across devices.

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelAhonle1/SocketProgramming_Server_Client.git
